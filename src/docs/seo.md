# About the SEO of the website

As we are in a competitive field, we want as much as possible to develop the natural sources of clients income. This document explains how we should do SEO in the site

## Next.js

Technically, the site is built using Next.js, using as much as possible of SSG (Static Site Generator) and the less we can of SSR (Server Side Rendering)

## SuperHead

We use a private package 'superhead' for handling the metadata generation of each page.
Each page should have it's own Head component injected with as much information as possible.

## Articles

We strive to develop a high end clientele, to do that, the content we create and put in the website is the most important key and we need to make sure our content is always in line with our current clientele and the one we are looking for.

Each article should have as much metadata as possible, a well thought title and should have a real purpose.
Idealy, we want to have a promoting part in maximum 1 of 3 articles.

Keep in mind that the content should be thought for 2 audiences : The current & The desired.
